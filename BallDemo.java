/**
 * Class BallDemo - a short demonstration showing animation with the 
 * Canvas class. 
 *
 * @author Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes
 * @version 2016.02.29
 * 
 * @ new Author: James Patti
 * Version 2025.21.25 (due 27th)
 * 
 * GOAL make a new method "boxBounce'
 * 
 * note: books says need a collection so arraylist,hashmap or hashset.
 * 2 need random utility for setting random positions for balls.
 * 5 to 30 balls needed
 * 
 * overall it good, not all done but tired, this felt worse then a hernia.
 * 
 * I NKNOW the issue the constructors is incorrect. so its 99% there.
 * 
 * ok correction..no where...need to make walls detect balls and basically making a microgame...I wish was better but this was a miserable project.
 * 
 * 
 * I tried, I am gonna work on next now, my brother burnt out, i;m burnt out. I trying to learn but this just too much at once.
